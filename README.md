# Go Shufflify

"Go Shufflify" is a web application that integrates with the Spotify API to provide a personalized music queue.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Authenticate users via Spotify and manage sessions.
- **Queue Management**: Automatically manages the music queue based on user preferences and active playlists.

## Project Structure

- `server.go`: Entry point for the application.
- `types/`: Contains all the data structures used across the application.
- `lib/`: Utility functions and common library code.
- `data/`: Functions for interacting with the Spotify API and the database.
- `routes/`: HTTP route handlers for various endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.16 or later)
- Spotify Developer Account with Client ID and Client Secret

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-shufflify.git
cd go-shufflify
```

2. Install the required Go packages:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SESSION_KEY=your_session_key # A really (!) random key, use 'uuid' or anything else generating random strings
PORT=3333
DB_FILE=./shufflify.db
```

4. Start the application

```bash
./start_server.sh
```

This will create the `shufflify.db` file and set up the necessary tables.
